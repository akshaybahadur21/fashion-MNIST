## Digit Recognition using Softmax Regression
This code helps you classify different clothing attire using softmax regression.


### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Description
Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- fashiom MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify clothes :         
		0: 'T - shirt / top',
        1: 'Trouser',
        2: 'Pullover',
        3: 'Dress',
        4: 'Coat',
        5: 'Sandal',
        6: 'Shirt',
        7: 'Sneaker',
        8: 'Bag',
        9: 'Ankleboot'

#### Choose between your algorithms from Logistic Regression, Shallow Network and a Deep Network.

### Execution
To run the code, type `python fashion.py`

```
python fashion.py
```
